*Which points have to be done to write a library:*

* TODO: brainstorming: 
** TODO: What is the need for writing this library
** TODO: What should the library be able to do - which functions.
* TODO: folder and files organisation as e.g. with cookiecutter ([[http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html][cookiecutter documentation]]): 
** TODO: install cookiecutter: 
- $ pip install --user cookiecutter
- $ conda install cookiecutter
- $ sudo apt-get install cookiecutter
** TODO: chose and clone a cookiecutter template (e.g. pypackage) and generate a project:
- $ git clone git@github.com:audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.git
- $ cookiecutter cookiecutter-pypackage/
Or directly from the repository (gh: Github):
- $ cookiecutter gh:audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage
** Cookiecutter generates then a project corresponding to your entered values with the following structre: 
project_name\
- AUTHORS.rst
- CONTRIBUTING.rst
- *project_name_test*
  - cli.py
  - project_name_test.py
  - __init__.py
- *docs*
  - authors.rst
  - conf.py
  - contributing.rst
  - history.rst
  - index.rst
  - installation.rst
  - make.bat
  - Makefile
  - readme.rst
  - usage.rst
- HISTORY.rst
- LICENSE
- Makefile
- MANIFEST.in
- README.rst
- requirements_dev.txt
- setup.cfg
- setup.py
- *tests*
  - __init__.py
  - test_project_name_test.py
- tox.ini
- travis_pypi_setup.py 
* TODO: testing and code writing:
** TODO install pytest: 
- $ pip install -U pytest
** TODO write your tests ([[https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html][Getting started with Pytest]]): 
- The test_file (tests/test_project_name_test.py) as well as the test function names need to start with 'test_'.
- import the code-file (project_name.py): 'import project_name as project_name_shortcut'
- write test functions: 'assert' expected outcome to library generated outcome
- The tests will first fail, because no code is available. Now a code file has to be written, adapted to the tests.
** TODO write your code: 
- Adapted to the test_functions a code has to be written so that the tests can pass.
