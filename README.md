# Checklist for generating a Python library

Generating a Python library or a tool or pipeline, is not only about writing the code, but also about testing the code, documenting it and at the end to make it public available. Therefore, this repository contains a checklist which goes step by step through this process, which starts at the point, where an idea for a Python library exists, until the point where the library is public available.

For org-mode users the 'org_checklist.org' file can be used.
