# Which points have to be done to write a library:

## Brainstorming: 
- [ ] What is the need for writing this library
- [ ] What should the library be able to do - which functions.

## Folder and files organisation as e.g. with cookiecutter ([Cookiecutter documentation](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)): 
- [ ] Install cookiecutter (different options): 
```
$ pip install --user cookiecutter
$ conda install cookiecutter
$ sudo apt-get install cookiecutter
```
- [ ] Chose and clone a cookiecutter template (e.g. pypackage) and generate a project:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage.git
$ cookiecutter cookiecutter-pypackage/
```
Or directly from the repository (gh: Github):
```
$ cookiecutter gh:audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage
```
Cookiecutter generates then a project corresponding to your entered values. Cookiecutter-pypackage generates a folder named after the project name, which includes several files, as e.g. 'AUTHORS.rst', 'LICENSE' or 'requirements_dev.txt' and the three folder 'project-name_test', 'docs' and 'tests', which again contain several files, which are requiered for the project.

## Testing and code writing:
- [ ] Install pytest: 
```
$ pip install -U pytest
```
- [ ] Write your tests ([Pytest Introduction](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html "Getting started with Pytest")): 
- The test_file (tests/test_project_name_test.py) as well as the test function names need to start with 'test_'.
- import the code-file (project_name.py):
```python
import project_name as project_name_shortcut
```
In case that the code file is not in the tests folder, but in another folder (e.g. 'project'), a link can be created as the following:
```
$ ln -s path/to/code_file/folder link/destination
```
The following folder structure can be used as an example: <br/>
\project <br/>
| <br/>
-- CodeFolder <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;   | <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;   -- CodeFile.py <br/>
-- tests <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;   | <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;   -- test_file.py <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;   -- CodeFolder (link) <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      | <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      -- CodeFile.py <br/>
Then, the code-file can be imported as the following:
```python
import CodeFolder.CodeFile as shortcut
```

- write test functions: 'assert' expected outcome to library generated outcome
- The tests will first fail, because no code is available. Now a code file has to be written, adapted to the tests.
- [ ] Write your code: 
- Adapted to the test_functions a code has to be written so that the tests can pass.

## Documentation with Sphinx:
- [ ] Install sphinx (different options):
```
$ apt-get install python-sphinx
$ pip install sphinx
$ conda install -c anaconda sphinx
```
- [ ] Run Sphinx:
```
$ sphinx-quickstart
```
A 'conf.py' file will be created, where the entry values can still be changed.
For adding more files for the documentation, reStructuredText files (.rst) can be written, as for example 'installation.rst', and included in the index.rst file as the following:
```
Welcome to MyProject's documentation!
*************************************

Table of content
================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :numbered:
	      
   introduction
   tutorial
   code
   installation
```
All reStructuredText files have to be in the same folder.

__Autogenerated Code documentation:__
If an autogenerated code documentation is desired, the following has to be done:
- [ ] Docstrings in the code file, out of which the documentation can be build, has to be written.
- [ ] by running 'sphinx-quickstart' 'autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules' has to be chosen.
- [ ] a code.rst file has to be written with the following input:
```
API
###

.. automodule:: Code_file
   :members: 
```
Whereby the name of the code file will be written without the suffix '.py'. <br/>

__sphinx_rtd_theme:__
For the sphinx theme 'Read the Docs', the following has to be changed in the conf.py file:
```python
html_theme = "sphinx_rtd_theme"
```
